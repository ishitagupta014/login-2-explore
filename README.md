Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:-
  1)JSON maintains hierarchical structures, making it easier to hold related data in a single document and represent complex relationships.
 2) Most programming languages provide native support for deserializing JSON into objects, or provide lightweight JSON serialization libraries.
  3)JSON supports lists of objects, helping to avoid messy translations of lists into a relational data model.
 4) JSON is a commonly used file format for NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, Couchbase, and Azure Cosmos DB.
